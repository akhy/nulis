# Demon Slayer Analysis - Draft Post

## Source Material
From Notion: Demon Slayer Deep Dives

## Key Analysis Points to Expand

### 1. Haganezuka vs Gyokko - Obsession Theme
**Thesis:** Obsession as neutral force - purpose defines morality

**Key Points:**
- Both obsessive craftsmen/artists
- Gyokko: Creates twisted "art" from tortured/dead humans (destructive)
- Haganezuka: Perfects swords to protect life (constructive)
- Scene juxtaposition: evil artist attacks while righteous craftsman continues working
- Theme: Dedication itself is neutral - intention/purpose determines if admirable or monstrous

**Questions to explore:**
- Was this contrast intentional by Gotouge?
- Japanese shokunin (craftsman) culture taken to extremes
- How does this theme repeat throughout the series?

### 2. Female Authorship Impact
**Observation:** Gotouge's female perspective creates different shonen dynamics

**Evidence:**
- Tanjiro as "green flag" protagonist (empathy, non-confrontational, emotionally intelligent)
- Tengen's respectful portrayal despite polygamy (no pervert tropes)
- Mitsuri's backstory addressing real female pressures about conforming vs. authenticity
- Entertainment District arc handled maturely without heavy sexualization

**Analysis angle:** How female authorship subverts typical male-authored shonen tropes

### 3. Your Personal Context
- Usually dislike typical shonen protagonists (Naruto, Luffy)
- Tanjiro is an exception
- Appreciate characters who earn trust through actions, not "ceramah no jutsu"
- Prefer linguistic neutrality (English you/I vs Bahasa Indonesia hierarchical pronouns)
